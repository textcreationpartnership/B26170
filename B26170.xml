            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS the frequenting and tipling in Taverns, Alehouses, Coffee-houses, and other Victualling-houses, is too much used and practised within this City on the LORD's-DAY, to the great dishonour and scandal of the Reformed Religion: And althô the same is provided against by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and certain Penalties are thereby inflicted upon Transgressors, yet the same are little observed thrô the remiss Execution of the said Laws; And Men thrô Impunity presume to employ and mispend their Time on that Day in such Publick-Houses, which ought to be employed in God's Publick Worship and Service, or private Acts of Piety and Devotion, as the Christian Religion requires, and the said Laws enjoyn. Wherefore to the end, That as much as in me lies (with the help and concurrence of You and the rest of my Brethren the <hi>Aldermen</hi>) the said Laws may be better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and that loose Practice prevented within this City and the Liberties thereof; These are in Their <hi>Majesty</hi>'s name, to desire and require You, to take all possible care within your Ward (with the assistance of your <hi>Deputy</hi> and <hi>Common Council Men,</hi> and the several <hi>Constables</hi> and <hi>Churchwardens</hi> in Your Ward, whom You are to call before You for that purpose, and give them a strict Charge in this behalf, That the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> may for the future be more Religiously and Duly observed, and all Persons deterred from the Profanation thereof, by the strict and constant Execution of the Laws against Offenders; And that you charge and enjoyn the respective <hi>Constables</hi> and <hi>Churchwardens</hi> duly every <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> frequently in the Day-time and in the Evening, to search all Publick Houses (as well Coffee-Houses as others) and where they find any Persons tipling therein, that they take and set down their Names and Places of Abode, and from time to time certifie Me (or some other Justice of the Peace for this City) thereof; As also of the Housekeeper who shall harbour them; That the Penalties by Law in that case appointed may be duly and impartially levied, both upon the Persons tipling and also the Housekeeper; Which (the Offence being seen by a Justice of Peace, or proved before him by Two Witnesses) is <hi>Three shillings Four pence</hi> to be paid by every Person so unduly tipling, and <hi>Ten shillings</hi> by the Housekeeper, for the Poor of the Parish where such Offence is committed, (to be levied by the <hi>Constable</hi> or <hi>Churchwardens</hi> by Distress, if not paid within Six days:) And the <hi>Constables</hi> and <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens,</hi> for not doing their Duty therein, are to forfeit <hi>Forty shillings,</hi> to be levied by a Warrant from a Justice of Peace, for the use of the said Poor; Which Penalties are thought fit to be here set down, in order to the better putting the Laws in Execution. And You are also to cause Your <hi>Beadle,</hi> to give Notice to all Alehouse and Coffeehouse-keepers within Your Ward, That (besides levying upon them the aforesaid Penalty of <hi>Ten shillings</hi> for every Offence) they must expect to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and have their Licenses taken from them, in case they shall for the future permit Company to sit tipling in their Houses on the <hi>Lord's-Day:</hi> And Your are desired frequently to send for the said <hi>Constables</hi> and <hi>Churchwardens,</hi> and examine their Performance therein, and to take care that such as You shall find Remiss may undergo the Penalty of the Law. Herein Your especial Care is required, as You tender God's Honour and the Weal of this City.</p>
